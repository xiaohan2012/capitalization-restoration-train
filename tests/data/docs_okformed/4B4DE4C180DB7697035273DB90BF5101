Nanobiotix gets early positive safety results in head and neck clinical trial
(EPO:NANO), the developer of nano-medical technology, has announced positive preliminary safety results for its lead NBTXR3 product in the head and neck cancer phase I/II clinical trial.
The positive results mean a larger population of patients could be targeted with NBTXR3, the Paris based company said.
The pivotal trial is being carried on patients with soft tissue sarcoma (cancer found in muscle and fat) and is the last before the NBTRX3 is submitted for registration in Europe.
In addition, the similarity of results so far in regard to how the product worked in head and neck suggests it could be transferred to other types of tumours, the firm added.
Elsa Borghi of said: “These results represent critical advances for the global clinical development of NBTXR3.
"The principles of translational research are even stronger because the good local safety observed so far supports the planned initiation in other indications such as prostate cancer for example.
"In fact, the demonstration of the permanency of NBTXR3 within the tumor without leakage to the healthy tissues reinforces the relevance of using the NBTXR3 radioenhancer to solve limitations of radiotherapy in multiple clinical applications.”
The process involves particles of hafnium oxide injected directly to the tumour, although they can be administered intravenously or applied as a gel during surgery to give a targeted treatment.
The non-toxic material is there to absorb x-rays as well as enhance the dose of radiotherapy. This targeted approach means the dose in the tumour can be increased without hurting healthy tissues surrounding it.
