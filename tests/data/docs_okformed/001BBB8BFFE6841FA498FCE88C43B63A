UPDATE - Nanobiotix gets early Positive Safety rEsults IN head and neck clinical trial
---adds share price, broker comment---
(EPO:NANO), the developer of nano-medical technology, has announced positive preliminary safety results for its lead NBTXR3 product in the head and neck cancer phase I/II clinical trial.
Efficacy data will not be released until the trial is completed.
The latest safety results mean a larger population of patients could be targeted with NBTXR3, including those receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the Paris based company said.
The pivotal trial is being carried on patients with soft tissue sarcoma (cancer found in muscle and fat) and is the last before the NBTRX3 is submitted for registration in Europe.
In addition, the firm said the results suggested it could be transferred to other types of cancer tumours.
Elsa Borghi of said: “These results represent critical advances for the global clinical development of NBTXR3.
"The principles of translational research are even stronger because the good local safety observed so far supports the planned initiation in other indications such as prostate cancer for example.
"In fact, the demonstration of the permanency of NBTXR3 within the tumor without leakage to the healthy tissues reinforces the relevance of using the NBTXR3 radioenhancer to solve limitations of radiotherapy in multiple clinical applications.”
Broker Stifel, which ratesd the shares 'buy', said: "To date, the only clinical data to be released for NBTXR3 is in the treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS).
"While the initial reports in this indication are very encouraging, the target population is relatively small. Confirmation that use of the product is feasible and safe in a new indication raises hopes that this technology could be established as a multi-indication treatment of cancer.
"We continue to believe that the initial approval of the product in STS could be received in 2016 and that further data on H&N cancer could be released later this year."
Stifel has a €25.5 target price on the shares, which are up 0.25% to €20.22 at the time of writing.
The process involves particles of hafnium oxide injected directly to the tumour, although they can be administered intravenously or applied as a gel during surgery to give a targeted treatment.
The non-toxic material is there to absorb x-rays as well as enhance the dose of radiotherapy. This targeted approach means the dose in the tumour can be increased without hurting healthy tissues surrounding it.
